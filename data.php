 L-world is a game about partnership, friendship and parenthood. It takes place on private party of few friends. The host of the party are Sabine, who is very active in the LGBT movement, her wife Veronica and her daughter Denise.
There are pre-written characters and given setting in the game, but the gameplay supports freedom of players. The game is less controlled by organizer, there are some organizer’s inputs during the game (NPC on phone). Secrets are important for the game.
Most of the characters in the game live in a homosexual partnership. Nevertheless, the game does not deal with homosexual themes specifically. It focuses more on what people, and women especially, look for in their relationships, either in partnership or in family.
The game is not inspired by so-called TV series.',

Families Lanz and Pereira have been torn apart by ancient wrongs and carefully hidden secrets. However, love will conquer all! The game takes place in present-day Venezuela or in a cheap film studio; depending on how much will the players in their roles of bad actors immerse into their parts. The larp is a tightly-scripted romantic crazy comedy divided into Scenes. It is an entertaining farce that contains all the clichés you have ever seen in bad TV series. "If you want a character that doesn\'t have a love plot in their story, you\'re at the wrong larp."

The game takes place somewhere in the foothills of Scottish highlands in a dark cottage, on an evening before a wedding. It is a perfect opportunity for five childhood friends to meet again. One of them is getting married on the next day. In a traditional ritual of plucking feathers and girly chatting during the game, it is important to discuss all the life experience, joys and sorrow. At the end of this night, a young girl becomes an adult woman prepared for marriage. What will young Agnes have to leave behind?
The game is divided into five acts, with almost theatrical parts. It is directed by the gamemaster playing an NPC interacting with the players. The storyline is not the main point; the game is based mainly on the atmosphere of girly chitchat and emotions around marriage. The atmosphere has a lot to do with the Theater of the Absurd.
One of the aims of the game is to make people think about the way they choose their partners and what they expect of them.

The game is set in the near future. The players assume roles of a married couple, Patrick and Erica, their autistic son Mathias, and Erica\'s friend Claudia. The players of Mathias and Claudia also act as the voices of the operating system. The game is divided into scenes with brief descriptions, which give enough space for improvisation. The game story is determined from the start, but the players can influence the exact ways it is enacted, as well as its end. The goal of the larp is to make the players think about the ways the present and future technology, social networks, and artificial intelligence can influence interpersonal relationships.

August 1945. The war in Europe ended three months ago, but ferocious battles continue to rage in the Pacific. A plane with 6 men lands at the American Johnston Island Air Force Base. These men represent several nations; they are ambassadors, secret service agents but also clergymen. This top secret meeting has one item on the agenda – a new weapon, never used before – the atomic bomb. Before they use it for the first time, Americans want majority of the representatives of the countries involved in the ending war to give their consent. However, each of the participants has their own goals and the only question is how far they are willing to go to achieve them. Pika-Don is a diplomatic larp about decision-making, asserting one’s interests, on responsibility and mainly on the meaning of ethics and morality. Character development does not rely on players themselves, but on the decisions they make in the game. The larp demonstrates how varying information on which we base both small and big decisions as well as our opinions on crucial events (e.g. dropping the atomic bomb) impact how we take perspective.',

The game Two Worlds works with a strong story of a girl whose world is starting to crack slowly, crumble down and fall in between her fingers. People around her are unable to help her and they don\'t understand her problems. Whether it is her mother, her therapist, her partner or friends - everyone is doing what they can and it\'s still not enough. Her life gets divided into two worlds and she is gradually losing the grip on either of them. The game works with scenes from her life, maps her most important decisions, encounters and conversation with her loved ones. The atmosphere is partially influenced by lights and shadows that serve to induce various moods in the players and pull them deeper into the story. The course and conclusion of the game are relatively tightly scripted. Players have no power to influence what happens in the game. What is important is HOW it\'s going to happen. This impossibility to influence the course of game events and playing with interpretations of the individual scenes should be the source of deep experience players get from this game. Although the game begins cheerfully, its course is gloomy, sad, serious and sometimes even a bit surreal. The goal is to open the topic of coping with problems one is not ready for in adolescence. “Kathie, is that you?”
